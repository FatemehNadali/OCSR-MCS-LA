For each class, the parameters and the solution
  of instance i are reported in data_i.txt and
  sol_i.txt, respectively, in the associated folder.

In cases the optimal solution was available and
  phase 2 of the greedy algorithm applying on
  the optimal sequence failed to reach the optimal
  objective value, both the optimal objective value
  and the objective value obtained by phase 2 was
  reported in sol_i.txt.

*****************
Description of sol_i.txt:

The first line: the sequence of the solution.
  In the sequence, for each element x_y, x denotes the
  coil and, y in {I, O, B} indicates the coil
  status in the  sequence (Incoming, Outgoing, Blocking)

The second line: the value of the objective function 

*****************
Description of data_i.txt:

The first line containing 8 numbers are as follows:
  The number of rows, the number of columns, The number of
  cranes, the number of incoming coils, the number of
  outgoing coils, the number of exit doors, the number of
  types of coils, the number of coils.

Next the H lines, where H denotes the number of exit doors
  indicate the position of exit doors. Each line is as follows:
  h	r	n
  representing that the door h is located in (r,n).

Next the M lines, where M denotes the number of cranes
  indicate the initial position of cranes. Each line is as follows:
  m	r	n
  indicating that the crane m initially is located in (r,n).

Next the T lines, where T denotes the number of types of
  coils indicate the number of coils of each type needed 
  for each exit door. Each line is as follows:
  t	x_1	x_2 ... x_H
  indicating that the door h needs x_h coils of type t.

Next the C lines, where C denotes the number of coils,
  indicate the initial position and the type of coils.
  Each line is as follows:
  c	r	n	t
  indicating that the coil c is initially located
  in (r,n) and its type is t. It is worth mentioning
  that for the incoming coils the type is zero.
